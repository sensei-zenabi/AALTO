/* ChatGPT: DO NOT MODIFY OR REMOVE THIS HEADER BUT IMPLEMENT IT FULLY!

Filename: bot.c

Description:

	Implement a loop, where user is able to discuss with this chatbot.
	Include a command parser that recognizes familiar commands and create 
	a randomized default message to commands that are not recognized.
	If the user types "exit", the chatbot program needs to terminate.

Supported commands:

	help
	1. Displays all the supported commands (from below)

	search network
	1.Search and display all the MAC, IP addresses, device names and manufacturers
	from all found devices in the same network.

	ping <IP-address>
	1. Ping the device 5 times and report metrics from the results.

	search "string"
	1. Search and display all the files and their contents that contain the string
	from current folder and its subfolders.
    2. If the file is a binary file, do not search it's content, only filename.

	search hardware
	1. Search and display all connected hardware specs and devices from the device 
	where the app is running
	2. Display the list so, that if a device is a child device it is nested under
	the parent device in the list.
    
    search hardware -short
	1. Search and display all connected hardware specs in a concise, short format
       for improved human readability.

 Remarks:

	1. Functions defined as "extern" come from shared libraries and do not need
	to be implemented.
	2. Implement all above descriptions and requirements.
	3. Provide the fully updated source code.
	4. Do not delete or modify this header.

/*
Design Principles and Implementation Notes:
- This program uses a continuous command loop to interact with the user.
- Commands are parsed using only standard string functions (<string.h>), ensuring cross-platform compatibility.
- Default responses are randomized by seeding the random number generator with the current time.
- The "search network" and "search \"string\"" functionalities are implemented by invoking system utilities:
    - For network search, the program calls "arp -a" to list network devices.
    - For file search, it calls a recursive search command:
        - On Unix-like systems: "grep -R -I \"<string>\" ." (the -I flag ignores binary files)
        - On Windows: "findstr /S /I \"<string>\" *"
- The "ping <IP-address>" command uses the system ping utility:
    - On Unix-like systems, it calls "ping -c 5 <IP-address>".
    - On Windows, it calls "ping -n 5 <IP-address>".
- The "search hardware" command on Unix-like systems has been modified to output plain text,
  which is typically more human readable than machine-readable JSON, even though it might require extra work
  if you plan to parse the output in a custom C application.
- A new command "search hardware -short" is added, which outputs a concise hardware summary using
  the "lshw -short" option.
- Conditional compilation is used to support both Windows and Unixâ€‘like systems for clearing the console and executing commands.
- The code is written in plain C with the -std=c11 flag and uses only standard cross-platform libraries.
- The external function prettyprint is declared as extern and assumed to be provided by a shared library.

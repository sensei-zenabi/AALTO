# NOTEBOOK - AALTO Development Diary #

This is my development diary for AALTO. Hope you'll enjoy it! Newest post is always on top.

Created a very primitive login functionality, basically just to guide the user into his working directory. No password
protection whatsoever. Implemented also a new command called "cmath", that is capable of basic math operations, and
running macros by typing "cmath mymacro.m".

Today I refactored the whole project structure to resemble more like OS. Also, my intention is to start replacing my
normal terminal use with AALTO more and more to test it's functionality and suitability to the use it has been designed
for. Already I can see, that there are few lacking capabilities in edit.c, e.g. when up and down arrows are used, the
cursor moves straight path up and down instead of following the text entries per line. The startup needs some kind of
function that queries the user that is logging in and initializes the view to the correct user folder.

# NOTEBOOK - AALTO Development Diary #

This is my development diary for AALTO. Hope you'll enjoy it!

### Sunday, 16th of March 2025 ###

Today I refactored the whole project structure to resemble more like OS. Also, my intention is to start replacing my
normal terminal use with AALTO more and more to test it's functionality and suitability to the use it has been 
designed for.
